# Virtual Terminal (WIP)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/epvt0 full width (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



## Introduction

The Virtual Terminal (VT) is a web application that provides all types of credit card processing functionality. The VT is the fastest way to start trying out our payment services.&#x20;

{% embed url="https://easypay5.com/VT" %}

When you log in to the Virtual Terminal, you are brought to the home screen. The number of open transactions and scheduled payments due display at the top of the screen. Your default merchant and user roles are listed just below, along with the expiration date of your password.&#x20;

## Payments

Instructions on how to manage various payments using the Virtual Terminal.&#x20;

Before you start, you may want to read about using your Verifone device with the Virtual Terminal in the [verifone-v1.md](verifone-v1.md "mention") guide.



### Non-EMV Payments

Click the _Credit Cards_ tab on the left side of the screen, then _Sale_.

When you swipe the credit card through your USB reader, the card information will automatically populate securely into the required fields. After swiping, enter the $ amount to be charged. You may also manually enter the information on your keyboard.

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/info-same-as-cardholder.md" %}

A patient / guest ID or a service description can also be added here and searched for later. The ID will also print on the **receipt**, and the service description will print on the **settlement report**.



### EMV Payments

Click the _Credit Cards_ tab on the left side of the screen, then on _Sale-EMV_.&#x20;

You will click _Insert Chip_ or _Manual Card Entry_.&#x20;

Clicking on _Insert Chip_ will prompt the end-user or customer to insert or tap their card for contactless payments. For _Manual Card Entry_, the end user must enter the full card number, expiration date, and CVV code by pressing the green enter button on the Verifone after each entry.&#x20;

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/info-same-as-cardholder.md" %}

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/block-cardholder-data-on-receipt-and-batch-report.md" %}



***



## Create consents

All consent types allow a card to be charged without the card or customer being present. Consents can be created by swiping the card or manually entering the information.

A consent receipt is always created by the system for your customer to sign. We encourage your office to get signatures for consents whenever possible.

An email address can be added to the consent so your customer will receive a receipt when the consent has been used.&#x20;

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/info-same-as-cardholder.md" %}

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/block-cardholder-data-on-receipt-and-batch-report.md" %}



### Annual and one-time

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/epvt2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Creating annual and one-time consents allows your office to charge a card at a later date. **This can be useful in situations where you expect a balance to be due after services have been provided.**

Annual consents require that a max charge be determined as a limit per transaction. This can be any $ amount determined by your office.&#x20;

An annual consent can be used multiple times, and a one-time consent can only be used once.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Both annual and one-time consents are valid until the card expires or 365 days have passed.
{% endhint %}

An email address can be added to the consent so your customer will receive a receipt when the consent has been used.&#x20;

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/info-same-as-cardholder.md" %}

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/block-cardholder-data-on-receipt-and-batch-report.md" %}



### Fixed recurring

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/epvt3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Creating a fixed recurring consent allows your office to set up a payment plan with your customer.  **This can be useful in situations where your customer has an outstanding balance due.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Fixed recurring consents can be setup for any length of time.
{% endhint %}

An email address can be added to the consent so your customer will receive a receipt

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/info-same-as-cardholder.md" %}

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/block-cardholder-data-on-receipt-and-batch-report.md" %}



### Subscription

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/epvt4.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Creating a subscription consent allows your office to set up a re-occurring payment indefinitely. **This can be useful in situations where your customer makes a regular donation or payment to your organization.**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The subscription consent end date is always automatically set to the card expiration date.
{% endhint %}

Subscription payments can be processed manually or automatically depending on your preference. You can change the payment amount as well as the scheduled dates for your subscription consent.&#x20;

To alter the schedule, you will modify the _Payment Adjust Date_. **The system will discard the previously scheduled payment plan and calculate a new one.** Only those scheduled payments for today and beyond will get processed, and it will not attempt to process payments for dates in the past.&#x20;

You can also place a subscription on hold. **This will pause all processing until the hold is released.** Once released, payments will resume for all present and future payments as calculated using your dates and amounts.

## Consent list

The consent list is where you will manage your consents after they have been created.  The query filter can be used to search your consent list.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/epvt5.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the _Consent Operations_ box right above the table, there are several options available to help you manage your consents.

{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

The option to reschedule or cancel a payment are also available on this screen.
{% endstep %}

## Lockouts

In order to protect our clientâ€™s information, it is necessary for us to lockout users who cannot provide correct credentials. **A lockout will occur if incorrect credentials are entered 6 times in a row.**&#x20;

There are two types of lockouts:&#x20;

* **User lockout** occurs when a user entered their **password** incorrectly for 6 successive attempts.&#x20;
* **Endpoint lockout** causes your entire office to be locked out because the **username** entered was unknown to our system, and used for 6 successive attempts.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are experiencing problems authenticating, contact your administrator to reset your credentials. **We recommend to do this before the 6th attempt which could cause a lockout.**
{% endhint %}



If you do experience a **user lockout**, you will need to follow these steps to continue:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Get new credentials

Obtain new or updated credentials from your administrator
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Reset the terminal

Visit the [reset page](https://easypay5.com/reset) to clear any cookies that have been set on your terminal.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Try using your new credentials

Login with the new or updated credentials.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

If you do experience an **endpoint lockout**, you will first need to need to call the [Number support team](../../../help/customer-support/) to get the lock removed, then follow the instructions for a user lockout.&#x20;



### Expired Passwords&#x20;

As an additional security precaution, passwords expire after 4 months. You can see your password expiration date every time you log into the Virtual Terminal. &#x20;

You may choose to change your password as often as you wish, however you must change your password every 4 months at a minimum. **Entering an expired password 6 times in succession will cause a user lockout as described above.**

&#x20;
