### A few steps to get started&#x20;

To get your business started with Number, follow these general steps for implementation:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### **Create a Number Account**:

Sign up for a Number Sandbox account to gain access to the platform and its features. Ensure you have all necessary business information ready for registration.

{% hint style="info" %}
Contact us to sign up for a Number Sandbox account: \
[partners@number.tech](mailto:partners@number.tech)  /  (866) 927-9344
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Obtain credentials**

After account creation, retrieve the necessary credentials from the Number Client Admin Portal. This will be essential for encryption and authentication.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Choose your integration method**

Decide on the integration method that best suits your business needs. Options include:

* **REST API and the PayForm**: Utilize the Number API and a customizable pre-built payment form that can be integrated directly into your site.
* **Verifone**: Collect payments using Verifone card readers with our software.
* **Mobile SDK**: If you have a mobile application, use the Number SDK for in-app payments.
* **Virtual Terminal**: A web application for processing payments directly through a browser.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Integrate our solution**

Depending on the integration method of choice, you might need to develop code to call our APIs or SDKs, or simply install some software and log in.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Test your integration on a development environment**

Before going live, thoroughly test your integration in a sandbox environment. Ensure that all payment flows work as expected and that you can handle various transaction scenarios.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Number inspection

The Number team always inspects the workflow that our clients develop prior to going Live.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Go live**

Once testing is complete and you are satisfied with the implementation, switch to the production environment. Update your configuration as necessary.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Monitor and maintain**

After launching, continuously monitor your payment processing for any issues. Regularly check for updates from Number to ensure compliance and security.
