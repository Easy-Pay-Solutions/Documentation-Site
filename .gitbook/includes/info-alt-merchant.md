{% hint style="info" %}
When you create a 'Card On File' or consent, you specify a merchant. When processing the consent, the system defaults to sending these funds to the original merchant.&#x20;

If you plan to process with an alternate merchant, ask your support rep to adjust the settings on your account to `ProcessCreditWithAlternateMerchant = true`.
