# Basics (v1)

To get the most out of using Number services, you'll need to define the type of integration (or integrations) you need, and learn some basic concepts around how to integrate. In the next sections, you can read about all of the [integration options](../integration-options-v1/) and find an [integration checklist](../integration-checklist.md) to give you an overview of all the steps required to start using our services.

If you choose to use the REST or SOAP API, we recommend you to learn the basics of [authentication with Number](api-authentication-v2.md), as well as how to [handle loggging](api-logging-v1.md), and the [backend input validation](api-input-validation-v1.md). You may also need to refer to the resources about [Number query language](../../resources/querying.md) and [error codes](../../resources/error-codes.md) once you start working on the integration.

For all major types of integrations, there are also additional guides under their respective sections.
