# Developer Portal Structure

Number Developer Portal website structure constists of 4 main sections:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Navigation column

This is where all new subpages that make up the Documentation section should be added.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**

The structure of the page, categories, and subcategories are the result of analysis conducted by the developer. When adding any new subpage, make sure that it is assigned to the appropriate group, category, and subcategory.
{% endhint %}

The structure of the navigation column should be clear and allow easy access to the most important information.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Tablet of contents

This is a part that fills in automatically and is based on the content of subpages. There is no way to edit this section. All content in the form of H1, H2 and H3 text will be added here while writing content in the main content block.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Top navigation bar

There are links here that allow you to switch between instances such as: Documentation, API Reference, Ask AI (AI Assistant, which cannot be edited - is on a separate subpage)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Page content block

The place on the page where the documentation content is located.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Good practices

We recommend the following solutions when adding additional content to the developer portal:

* Before adding a section, category, or subcategory in the navigation column, make sure there is no other place on the page where the content could be assigned.

***

* If there is a need to add a link to an external site, we can divide them into three categories:
  * A link that complements the content of a specific subpage/category/subcategory: in this case, the link should be located in the content it complements.
  * A link that supplements the content of the entire page: in this case, the link should be placed as a separate item in the top navigation bar.
  * A link to the external page, like: Ai Assistant, Number informational website etc: in this case, the link should be placed as a separate item in the top navigation bar.

***

* Each main category of the page should have an icon assigned (from the Gitbook icon collection - you can select them at "Page title")

***

* Each main category of the website should have a graphic in the hero section - to assist the user in navigating through extensive documentation.
