`Token` string

The `Token` is a 32-characater hexadecimal string generated from the Client Admin Portal which acts as a password when authenticating to our APIs. A newly generated `Token` will be good for 2 years. Keep your tokens stored safely and securely, and do not email them without extra layers of security.
