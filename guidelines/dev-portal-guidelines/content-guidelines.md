# Content Guidelines



### Typography

The font family selected in Gitbook settings to create this page is **Inter** - a modern font that can also be used on other Number pages and materials.

> The administrator cannot manipulate the size and style of individual fonts.

**To build page content, we recommend using the following font types available in GitBook:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Heading 1

{% hint style="info" %}
Font style visible in the **Table of Contents** section.
{% endhint %}

It is recommended to skip this font size on subpages where it is not necessary (it is too large).&#x20;

It is allowed to be used on subpages consisting of a large number of sections and subsections - to which the user should have easy access.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Heading 2

{% hint style="info" %}
Font style visible in the **Table of Contents** section.
{% endhint %}

It should be used in place of H1 on subpages where one level of category visible in the Table of Contents section will be sufficient.\

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Heading 3

Recommended for subsections titles.&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Paragraph Bold

Recommended for the next level of subsections titles and parts of the paragraphs that should be highlighted.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Paragraph Regular

It should be used in paragraph text and as the main content of other available components (e.g. hint, ordered / unordered lists, cards etc.)


{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Exceptions to the use of specific font types:**

To improve the readability of the content, it is allowed to use fonts in the size H2, H3 in the component headings (e.g. hint, ordered / unordered lists, cards etc.) - they will not appear as Table of Contents categories.
{% endhint %}
