# REST API

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/REST API C.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Our REST API can be used to integrate any frontend or backend application with Number and use all of our payment services. This way, you have full control over the presentation, and we'll handle the complex payment processes.\
\
We recommend following [our REST API integration guide](../../documentation/getting-started/integration-options/rest-api.md) to get started. It'll teach you all of the generic concepts you need to correctly authenticate, consume API responses, and how to recognize and handle errors, alongside code examples.
