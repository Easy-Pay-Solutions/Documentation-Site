description: Getting started with the REST API for Number

# REST API (WIP)

Our REST API allows full integration of Number services with a high degree of customization. You can use our [REST API reference](../../../api-reference/rest-api-v2/) to learn about specific methods in the API.

Before you continue this section, we recommend reading sections with basics around [authentication](../basics-v1/api-authentication-v3.md), [logging](../basics-v1/api-logging-v1.md), and [input validation](../basics-v1/api-input-validation-v1.md).
