# Content Guidelines



### Typography

The font family selected in Gitbook settings to create this page is **Inter** - a modern font that can also be used on other Number pages and materials.

> The administrator cannot manipulate the size and style of individual fonts.

**To build page content, we recommend using the following font types available in GitBook:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Heading 1

{% hint style="info" %}
Font style is visible in the **Table of Contents** section.
{% endhint %}

It is recommended to skip this font size on subpages where it is not necessary (it is too large).&#x20;

It is allowed to be used on subpages consisting of a large number of sections and subsections - to which the user should have easy access.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Heading 2

{% hint style="info" %}
Font style is visible in the **Table of Contents** section.
{% endhint %}

It should be used in place of H1 on subpages where one level of category visible in the Table of Contents section will be sufficient.\

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Heading 3

Recommended for subsections titles.&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Paragraph Bold

Recommended for lower-level subsection titles and parts of paragraphs that should be highlighted.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Paragraph Regular

It should be used in paragraph text and as the main content of other available components (e.g. hints, ordered / unordered lists, cards, etc.).


{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Exceptions to the use of specific font types:**

To improve the readability of the content, it is allowed to use fonts in the sizes H2, and H3 in the component headings (e.g. hint, ordered / unordered lists, cards, etc.) - they will not appear as Table of Contents categories.
{% endhint %}

#### Spaces and dividers

To make the page content more readable, it is recommended to use an empty row of paragraph text as an additional spacer between the sections.

It is recommended to follow the recommendations for the spaces between the specific sections:&#x20;

* Main site section\
  \- Empty paragraph row\
  \- Divider\
  \- Empty paragraph row
* Extended unordered list of content-rich bullet points\
  \- Divider
* Content-rich subpage\
  \- Empty paragraph rows between the sections  and subsections
