Our REST API can be used to integrate any frontend or backend application with Number and use all of our payment services. This way, you have full control over the presentation, and we'll handle the complex payment processes.\

We recommend following our guide \[link] to get started using the REST API. It'll teach you all of the generic concepts you need to correctly consume the API responses as well as how to recognize and handle errors.
